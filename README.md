# liri-node-app

Week 10 (LIRI Bot)
7. Make it so liri.js can take in one of the following commands:

	* `my-tweets`

	* `spotify-this-song`

	* `movie-this`

	* `do-what-it-says`

### What Each Command Should Do
1. `node liri.js my-tweets`
		
	* This will show your last 20 tweets and when they were created at in your terminal/bash window.

2. `node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'`

	* This will show the following information about the song in your terminal/bash window
		* Artist(s)
		* The song's name
		* A preview link of the song from Spotify
		* The album that the song is from

	* if no song is provided then your program will default to
		* "The Sign" by Ace of Base

3. `node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'`

	* This will output the following information to your terminal/bash window:

		* Title of the movie.
		* Year the movie came out.
		* IMDB Rating of the movie.
		* Country where the movie was produced.
		* Language of the movie.
		* Plot of the movie.
		* Actors in the movie.
		* Rotten Tomatoes Rating.
		* Rotten Tomatoes URL.

	* If the user doesn't type a movie in, the program will output data for the movie 'Mr. Nobody.'
		* If you haven't watched "Mr. Nobody," then you should: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0485947/
		* It's on Netflix!

4. `node liri.js do-what-it-says`
	* Using the `fs` Node package, LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.
		* It should run `spotify-this-song` for "I Want it That Way," as follows the text in `random.txt`.
		* Feel free to change the text in that document to test out the feature for other commands.

##### Addition

* In addition to logging the data to your terminal/bash window, output the data to a .txt file called `log.txt`.

* Make sure you append each command you run to the `log.txt` file. 

* Do not overwrite your file each time you run a command.
